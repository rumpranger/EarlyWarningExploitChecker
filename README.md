Early Warning Exploit Checker
==========================

Early warning exploit checker used to detect possible exploits being distributed by websites.

Script used to detect possible exploits being distributed by websites. Simple regular expressions used to determine potential problems based on collected data. These are greedy and produce many false positives which can be white listed on a case by case basis. This script does not give a definitive result as to whether the site is exploited or not however it can give a good hint.

#### Background ####
We host several thousand websites spread across the globe on dozens of shared and dedicated hosting accounts. These accounts are managed via plain unsecured FTP with passwords that are not only weak but shared by multiple users. Occasionally our accounts become compromised and code is injected into the served pages generally causing visitors to download malware.
